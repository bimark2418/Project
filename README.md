# Final Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This Repository contains the following files:

  - run_analysis.R, the R script used to generate the tidyData.txt file
  
  - CodeBook.md, contains a description of the variables in the file tidyData.txt
  
  - tidyData.txt is the dataset generated by running the script run_analysis.R
	

Instructions to Run run_analysis.R:

  - Open the script run_analysis.R either in R or in Rstudio
  
  - Set your working directory (dataPATH) to the UCI HAR Dataset folder (extracted from zip file), you can use the function setwd()
  
  - Run run_analysis.R, this will generate the file tidyData.txt on your working directory

run_analysis.R uses the R package dplyr, so check you have this package installed before running the script. The file CodeBook.md contains a description of the variables in the file tidyData.txt
